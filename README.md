          <p>This image is displayed on the top screen. <br>
          It must contain the "Creator's Room" text.</p>

          <h4>head</h4>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>foot</h4>
          <p>Head and foot are used as the top and bottom borders of the profile box.<br>
            <b>We recommend that you only change their color to match your theme,  as the profile box itself can only be styled with solid color.</b>

This image isn't part of the theme itself, but it is used as a thumbnail / preview image on the Sudomemo Theme Shop page. Please make sure that this image represents the overall look and feel of your theme. (:

### Guidelines / rules

#### Don't use too many colors or gradients

- Themes are limited to a palette of only 256 colors (i.e. they use a bitmap image format). Because of this, please try not to use too much shading or too many colors in your theme images.

#### No signatures or watermarks

- -- That is, should your theme be intended for the Theme Shop. Don't worry, there will be a link to your Sudomemo Creator's Room on your theme's page in the shop.

#### Keep it simple

- We would prefer simple, clean designs that fit in with the aesthetic of the Flipnote Studio app.

#### Follow the rules

- Of course, make sure that your theme follows the content rules as given in the [Sudomemo Terms of Use](http://www.sudomemo.net/help/?terms).

### Downloads

Here you can download a theme template file for the art software that you use.

### FAQ

#### If my theme is on the Theme Shop, will I recieve a commission when others buy it?

- Yes! When someone buys your theme, you will receive 1/5 of the price that they pay in color stars (Sudomemo's currency-of-sorts). For example, if your theme is selling for 10 color stars, you will recieve 2 color stars commission for each sale! You can use these stars to add to Flipnotes that you enjoy, or you can use them to purchase more themes for yourself.

#### Do I need Sudomemo Citizenship to make a theme?

- Sudomemo Citizenship isn't required. (:

#### Why can't I include copyrighted content or characters from a certain franchise?

- We will not allow themes that contain copyrighted content. Any themes containing copyrighted content would be classified as merchandise, as a result, we are unable to 'sell' them without express permission from the copyright holder.

#### How can I get in touch if I have questions?

- If you have questions about the theme kit, please email [support@sudomemo.net](mailto:support@sudomemo.net), and include "Theme Kit Question" in the subject line. Please note that we are unable to help with graphics software problems. If you're having trouble using a specific feature of your software, their support forum will be able to provide guidance. (:
